automatic sprite
================

As a frontend developer, I like to maintain sprites my way. Automatic Sprite is a humble Photoshop script that generates a CSS Image Sprite Sheet automatically, based on straightforward PSD layers reading.

Do you have a PSD Sprite? Have a try. I'll post examples soon.
